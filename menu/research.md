My research is primarily in computational (astro)physics. That is, I use and help build simulations. Below are some of my current and past works.

One of my ongoing projects is to study structural formation in the early universe-- particularly, proto-globular clusters-- by running radiation hydrodynamics simulations on high-performance computing clusters. The video above depicts Population II star formation in a dwarf galaxy for different assumed gas-to-star conversion efficiencies.

### Astroparticle Physics

$\nu$SpaceSim is an end-to-end Python simulation package designed to aid cosmic $\nu_\tau$ detection via atmospheric interactions. The software simulates all aspects of neutrino detection, from propagation to signal detection. It does this by sampling monte-carlo simulation libraries. Currently, I'm helping build the extensive air shower module. Checkout the [latest build](https://github.com/NuSpaceSim/nuSpaceSim).

### High Energy Physics

I was previously a part of a high energy physics group, helping assesses the performance of the endcap calorimeters of the CMS experiment at the LHC through simulations. The plot above shows the simulated and reconstructed hits from a particle gun for this specific detector component, the HGCAL. Knowing how well a certain detector geometry version can resolve energies at the TeV regime can help assess its future performance.
